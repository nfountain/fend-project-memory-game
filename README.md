# Memory Game Project

## Description

This is a recreation of the old Memory Game, also known as Concentration, which was originally played with physical cards that are flipped to reveal the faces of the cards. The goal of this game is to find each card's matching twin. The game is won once all cards are matched.

## Instructions

This game has been created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so a browser or an application/extension that can run files using these languages will be needed to play the game.

### Accessing the game:

  1. You may clone or download this repository to have all of the files on your local computer, then open [index.html](index.html) in your preferred web browser, to play the game.
  2. You may access the live preview of the game, via GitHub's live preview feature, [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/nfountain/fend-project-memory-game/blob/master/index.html).
  
### Playing the game: 

1. Click on a card to reveal the symbol on the face of that card. Clicking on a second card results in one complete move. If the cards match, they will remain open and the faces of the card will turn green.
2. Continue clicking on cards until all cards are matched.
3. Restart the game using the restart button, the play again button after winning, or reloading the window. Note: This will shuffle the deck again, so the order of the cards will not be the same as it was prior to restarting the game.

The original starter code for this project, including the majority of the HTML, CSS, and the shuffle function, was obtained from Udacity's course project page [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game), submitted by Richard Kalehoff. The [shuffle function](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976) from a StackOverflow response was provided as a part of this starter code.

The code for the modal that pops up when the game is won is courtesy of a Traversy Media video titled ["Create a Modal with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ophW7Ask_0).
